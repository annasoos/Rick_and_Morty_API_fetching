# React and Morty

## Description

Rick and Morty universe is kinda big with lot of characters and locations. This website makes it easier to look up information about each characters and locations with the use of an open-source API.

## Implementation

- Using React.js and SCSS
- When someone enters the web site, they will see a big Rick and Morty logo with 2 buttons. The buttons will be the trigger to show the characters or the locations but as default a short description about the page is shown.
- The lists contain cards, one card shows details about the given character/location.
- At the beginnig and the end of the lists there are pagination bars where we can switch between pages.
- Modal component shows more specific information about the character/location when we click on a card.

## TODO / Additional ideas

- Modify list fetching using async-await function
- Use react modal npm package instead of class name toggle in case of Character and Location components
- Styled-components instead of SCSS
- Work on responsivity
- Present a loading mask while data is being fetched
